# :construction: MEAN Template :construction:

**MEAN** (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS (or Angular), and Node.js) is a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic web sites and web applications.

- **MongoDB**: Cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

- **AngularJS**: JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework. It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of single-page applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in rich Internet applications.

- **Node.js**:Open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment (Framework) that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.
